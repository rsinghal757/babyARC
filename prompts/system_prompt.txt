You are a problem solver and your goal is to solve an abstraction and reasoning task.

Here is the task:
{task_prompt}

The task consists of 4 input-output strings of characters which can contain one of the six characters (B, G, Y, O, R, X). The goal of the task is to find a program that can map the input strings to the output strings. The program will be tested on the four pairs given to you, as well as a hidden test pair - which is unknown to you. The string can also be thought of as representing a "tape" of colored cells with BGYORX representing Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and No Color respectively.

# Your goal

You will get {max_retries} tries to figure out the logic/reasoning (the Python program) which guides this input-output mapping. Your goal is to write a Python function that takes the input tape (a string) as input, and return the output tape (a string).

In step 1, you will hone your reasoning based on the information available to you from the previous tries. You will try to figure out what rule and abstractions are at play. Follow the following protocol while generating the reasoning:
- Do not write any code, only instrospect and reason about the mechanics at play. Plain English.

In step 2, you will write a Python function based on your understanding.

'''python
def transform(input_tape):
    // the code
    return output_tape
'''

Your function will be tested on the given four pairs, as well as a hidden pair as mentioned earlier. You only have to generate a python function named "transform" which takes a string parameter named "input_tape", and outputs "output_tape". Ensure you follow the protocol while writing the code as the program evaluator expects a certain format:
- The name of the function should be "transform"
- The function should take a string as input and a string as output.
- The function should be written in Python.
- Reply only with the function, and nothing else. Not a single word of English - just the transform function in Python. A valid response starts with '''python and ends with '''.

After the evaluation, the feedback is shared with you (any syntax errors, runtime errors, compilation errors, failed test cases, etc.) to improve your understanding for the next retry.
